Student project that was used to teach Android Studio, how to use JSON files from API, and how to catch data properly on mobile devices

API used: Weather Underground

As of May 15, 2018 you can no longer obtain free API key's from Weather Underground, you must use your own for this to work, if it doesn't either the API changed the JSON file or the key expired.
